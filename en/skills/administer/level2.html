This competency is part of the 6 competencies of the BUT Computer Science program and represents the second level of learning (Critical Learning AC23). At this level, I am able to deploy applications with Docker (containerization tool), configure CI/CD environments (Continuous Integration / Continuous Deployment), and monitor performance (monitor system performance).

            This level represents an evolution in my ability to manage more complex infrastructures, automate deployments, and ensure system monitoring. These skills were developed mainly during <strong>semesters 3 and 4</strong> (second year of BUT Computer Science) through educational resources R2.05, R3.05, R3.06 and R4.08, as well as academic projects SAÉ 3.01, SAÉ 4.01 and my professional internship at HEVA.

              <p><strong>Justification:</strong> This project allowed me to learn to <strong>deploy services in a network architecture (AC23.01)</strong> by configuring and deploying a Laravel application with several services that had to work together: the web application, the database and authentication services. I also discovered the importance of <strong>securing services and data (AC23.03)</strong> by implementing authentication, authorization and data protection. I used knowledge from resources R2.05 (PHP Network Services), R3.05 (WebSockets) and R3.06 (Network Architecture).</p>
              <p><strong>Reflection:</strong> This project allowed me to understand how to deploy a complex application in a network architecture. The main difficulty was understanding how to correctly configure network services and secure the application. I overcame this difficulty by studying Laravel documentation, following security best practices, and applying concepts taught in resources R2.05, R3.05 and R3.06.

I also learned to <strong>secure services and data (AC23.03)</strong> by implementing security in a professional application with real users. This daily experience allowed me to apply my system administration skills in a real context with all production constraints.</p>
              <p><strong>Reflection:</strong> This internship was an enriching professional experience that allowed me to put into practice all the system administration skills acquired in class in a real context. The main difficulty was understanding how to deploy and administer an application in production with company constraints. I overcame this difficulty by communicating regularly with the team, following company procedures, and applying system administration best practices. This experience showed me the importance of system administration in production and allowed me to develop my confidence as a system administrator.</p>

            <strong>Progression</strong>
            Level 2 allowed me to develop my complex system administration skills. Through projects like Clone Uber (SAÉ 3.01 and SAÉ 4.01) and my internship at HEVA, I learned to containerize applications with Docker, deploy services in a network architecture, and secure services and data. These experiences allowed me to develop expertise in complex system administration, from service deployment to virtualization with Docker. The internship at HEVA particularly taught me to manage systems in production, thus preparing my entry into the professional world.
