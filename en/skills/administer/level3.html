            <div class="proof-card__section">
              <p><strong>Context:</strong> Academic project carried out in the third year (Semester 5) as part of SAÉ 5.01. This is a complex project developing an Android mobile application with Kotlin, integrating IoT (Internet of Things) via MQTT and Raspberry Pi, and using artificial intelligence, requiring the design and implementation of a complete and secure information system.</p>
              <p><strong>Trace:</strong></p>
              <ul>
                <li>Complete information system architecture with mapping (R4.09)</li>
                <li>MQTT communication security (IoT protocol) with cryptography (R3.09)</li>
                <li>Secure IoT architecture for data collection and processing</li>
                <li>Information system architecture documentation</li>
                <li>Application source code with secure architecture (project in progress, confidential)</li>
              </ul>
              <p><strong>Justification:</strong> This project allowed me to learn to <strong>participate in the design and implementation of an information system (AC33.01)</strong> by creating a complete architecture with a mapping that showed how everything was organized. I also discovered the importance of <strong>securing systems</strong> by protecting MQTT communication with cryptography so that data is well protected. I used knowledge from resources R4.09 (Advanced management of information systems, mapping) and R3.09 (Cryptography and security).</p>
              <p><strong>Reflection:</strong> This project is the most complex in terms of system administration as it combines several technologies (mobile, IoT, AI) requiring a sophisticated information system architecture. The main difficulty was designing a secure architecture for IoT while guaranteeing performance and reliability. I overcame this difficulty by studying secure IoT architectures, applying cryptography concepts, and using methods taught in resources R4.09 and R3.09. This project showed me the importance of designing information system architectures for complex projects.</p>

              <p><strong>Context:</strong> Professional work-study since September 2025 (4 months, in progress) as a Web Developer at Agence Altimax in Annecy.

              <p><strong>Justification:</strong> This work-study allowed me to learn to <strong>participate in the design and implementation of an information system (AC33.01)</strong> in a real professional context, by administering the company's WordPress systems. I discovered how to manage these systems on a daily basis. I also learned to <strong>adapt an information system to organizational needs (AC33.03)</strong> by adapting WordPress sites to the specific needs of each client. This daily experience allows me to apply my system administration skills in a real context with all professional constraints.</p>
              <p><strong>Reflection:</strong> This work-study is a continuous professional experience that allows me to develop my advanced system administration skills in a real context. The main difficulty was understanding how to administer and adapt WordPress systems according to client needs while respecting company constraints. I overcame this difficulty by communicating regularly with the team, following company procedures, and applying system administration best practices. This experience showed me the importance of adapting information systems to organizational needs and allowed me to develop my ability to manage systems in production.</p>

            Level 3 represents the culmination of my progression in system administration. Through projects like SmartHome (SAÉ 5.01) and my work-study at Agence Altimax, I developed my ability to participate in the design and implementation of information system projects, measure impacts, and adapt information systems to organizational needs. These experiences allowed me to develop expertise in advanced system administration, from designing complex architectures to adapting to organizational needs. The work-study particularly taught me to manage systems in production with real constraints, thus preparing my entry into the professional world.
