            <div class="proof-card__section">
              <p><strong>Context:</strong> Academic project carried out in the first year (Semester 1) as part of SAÉ 1.06. This was a document research and report writing project requiring identification of my aptitudes for working in a team, understanding the digital ecosystem, and acquisition of basic interpersonal skills.</p>
              <p><strong>Trace:</strong></p>
              <ul>
                <li>Written report (Word) with document research</li>
                <li>Oral presentation (Zoreto) of the report</li>

                <li>Documentation available on GitHub</li>
              </ul>
              <p><strong>Justification:</strong> This project allowed me to <strong>discover my aptitudes for working in a team (AC16.01)</strong> by carrying out a collaborative project where everyone had a role to play. I also learned to <strong>understand the digital ecosystem (AC16.02)</strong> by conducting in-depth document research on the digital environment. Finally, I developed my <strong>basic interpersonal skills (AC16.04)</strong> by communicating effectively with the team and presenting our work clearly. I used resources R1.11 (Document research, Ad hoc investigation report, Projet Voltaire) and R1.12 (Article and oral presentation).</p>
              <p><strong>Reflection:</strong> This project was my first teamwork experience in an academic context. The main difficulty was understanding how to collaborate effectively with my classmates and present the work clearly. I overcame this difficulty by communicating regularly with the team, distributing tasks, and applying communication techniques taught in resources R1.11 and R1.12. This project showed me the importance of communication and collaboration in teamwork.</p>

              <p><strong>Context:</strong> Academic project carried out in the first year (Semester 2) as part of SAÉ 2.06. This was a project to discover the economic and ecological environment requiring team collaboration and professional communication with a real company (Aqualac in Annecy).</p>

              <p><strong>Justification:</strong> This project taught me to <strong>understand the digital ecosystem (AC16.02)</strong> by discovering the economic and ecological environment in which companies operate. I also discovered <strong>statuses, functions and roles in an organization (AC16.03)</strong> by interacting with a real company and understanding how it was organized. Finally, I developed my <strong>basic interpersonal skills (AC16.04)</strong> by communicating professionally with the company and collaborating effectively with my team.</p>
              <p><strong>Reflection:</strong> This project was an enriching experience that allowed me to discover the real professional world. The main difficulty was understanding how to communicate professionally with a company and how to organize a seminar as a team. I overcame this difficulty by preparing exchanges with the company, coordinating work with the team, and applying developed interpersonal skills.

These experiences allowed me to develop a solid foundation in collaboration, from communication to understanding the professional environment. This first experience showed me the importance of teamwork and prepared me for the following levels where collaboration becomes more complex.
