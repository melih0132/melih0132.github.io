            <strong>Level 1</strong> of the <strong>COLLABORATE</strong> competency corresponds to simple team collaboration. This competency represents the first level of learning (Critical Learning AC16). At this level, I am able to identify my aptitudes for working in a team, understand the digital ecosystem (understand the digital environment), know statuses, functions and roles in an organization, and acquire basic interpersonal skills (communication, listening, respect).

            This level represents my first steps in teamwork, where I learned the basics of collaboration and team communication. These skills were developed during <strong>semesters 1 and 2</strong> (first year of BUT Computer Science) through educational resources R1.02, R1.08, R1.09, R1.10, R1.11, R2.02, R2.11, R2.12 and R2.13, as well as academic projects SAÉ 1.06 and SAÉ 2.06.

              <p><strong>Context:</strong> Academic project carried out in the first year (Semester 1) as part of SAÉ 1.06. This was a document research and report writing project requiring identification of my aptitudes for working in a team, understanding the digital ecosystem, and acquisition of basic interpersonal skills.</p>
              <p><strong>Trace:</strong></p>

              <p><strong>Justification:</strong> This project allowed me to <strong>work effectively in a team (AC16.01)</strong> by carrying out a collaborative project where everyone had a role to play. I also learned to <strong>communicate with different stakeholders (AC16.02)</strong> by communicating effectively with the team and presenting our work clearly. I used resource R1.11 (Document research, Ad hoc investigation report, Projet Voltaire).</p>
              <p><strong>Reflection:</strong> This project was my first teamwork experience in an academic context. The main difficulty was understanding how to collaborate effectively with my classmates and present the work clearly. I overcame this difficulty by communicating regularly with the team, distributing tasks, and applying communication techniques taught in resource R1.11. This project showed me the importance of communication and collaboration in teamwork.</p>

            <strong>Progression</strong>
            Level 1 allowed me to acquire the basics of team collaboration. Through projects like SAÉ 1.06 and SAÉ 2.06, I learned to identify my aptitudes for working in a team, understand the digital ecosystem, know statuses, functions and roles, and acquire basic interpersonal skills. These experiences allowed me to develop a solid foundation in collaboration, from communication to understanding the professional environment. This first experience showed me the importance of teamwork and prepared me for the following levels where collaboration becomes more complex.
