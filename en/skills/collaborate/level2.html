              <p><strong>Context:</strong> Academic project carried out in the second year (Semester 2) as part of SAÉ 2.06. This was a project to organize a professional seminar with the company Aqualac in Annecy, requiring team collaboration, professional communication, and event organization.</p>
              <p><strong>Trace:</strong></p>
              <ul>
                <li>Organization of a professional seminar with the company Aqualac</li>

              <p><strong>Justification:</strong> This project allowed me to learn to <strong>understand my role and missions in an organization (AC26.01)</strong> by discovering what was expected of me in organizing this seminar. I also learned to <strong>integrate into a team (AC26.02)</strong> by adapting my work to collaborate effectively with others. Finally, I developed my <strong>interpersonal skills (AC26.03)</strong> by communicating professionally with the company Aqualac. I put into practice what I learned in resources R2.13 (Communication with the professional environment) and R2.14 (Professional and personal project).</p>
              <p><strong>Reflection:</strong> This project was an enriching experience that allowed me to develop my complex collaboration skills. The main difficulty was coordinating teamwork and communicating professionally with the company. I overcame this difficulty by regularly organizing team meetings, distributing tasks, and applying communication techniques taught in resources R2.13 and R2.14.

              <p><strong>Context:</strong> Academic project carried out in the second year (Semester 3) as part of SAÉ 3.01.

I also learned to <strong>report on my activity (AC26.04)</strong> by documenting my work and regularly communicating project progress to the team. I used Agile methodology (Scrum) to organize our teamwork in a structured way.</p>
              <p><strong>Reflection:</strong> This project was my first in-depth experience with Agile methodology in a team. The main difficulty was coordinating tasks between multiple developers and managing complex interactions. I overcame this difficulty by using project management tools (Trello, GitHub), organizing regular meetings, and applying Agile methodology principles. This project showed me the importance of coordination and communication in complex teamwork.</p>

I applied skills developed in resource R4.06 (Groups, Meetings).</p>
              <p><strong>Reflection:</strong> This project was the most complex in terms of collaboration as it combined several technologies requiring effective coordination. The main difficulty was coordinating work between backend (.NET) and frontend (Vue.js) developers. I overcame this difficulty by organizing regular technical meetings, documenting interfaces, and applying collaboration best practices. This project showed me the importance of technical communication and coordination in complex projects.</p>

              </ul>
              <p><strong>Justification:</strong> This internship allowed me to learn to <strong>understand my role and missions in an organization (AC26.01)</strong> by discovering what was expected of me in the company and what my responsibilities were. I also learned to <strong>integrate into a team (AC26.02)</strong> by adapting to the developer team's functioning and adjusting my work to collaborate effectively. I developed my <strong>interpersonal skills (AC26.03)</strong> and learned to <strong>report on my activity (AC26.04)</strong> by communicating regularly with the team and explaining what I had done. I used resources R3.13 (CV, Interview, Popularization) and R4.06 (Groups, Meetings, Infographics and Data Visualization).</p>
              <p><strong>Reflection:</strong> This internship was an enriching professional experience that allowed me to develop my complex collaboration skills in a real context. The main difficulty was understanding how to integrate into an existing professional team and understanding company processes. I overcame this difficulty by communicating regularly with the team, asking questions, and applying developed interpersonal skills. This internship showed me the importance of integration and communication in the professional world and allowed me to develop my ability to collaborate effectively in a team.</p>

            <strong>Progression</strong>
            Level 2 allowed me to develop my complex collaboration skills. Through projects like SAÉ 2.06, SAÉ 3.01, SAÉ 4.01 and my internship at Helvetics Events, I learned to situate my role and missions in an organization, apply an integration approach, mobilize adapted interpersonal skills, and report on my activity. These experiences allowed me to develop expertise in complex collaboration, from understanding my role to contributing to technical decisions. The internship particularly taught me to collaborate in a real professional context, thus preparing my entry into the professional world.
