            <strong>Level 2</strong> of the <strong>COLLABORATE</strong> competency corresponds to position one's role and missions within an IT team. This competency represents the second level of learning (Critical Learning AC26). At this level, I am able to situate my role and missions in an organization, apply an integration approach (integrate into a team), mobilize adapted interpersonal skills (communication, negotiation), and report on my activity (report my work).

            <div class="proof-card__section">
              <p><strong>Context:</strong> Academic project carried out in the second year (Semester 3) as part of SAÉ 3.01. This was a complex web application development project with Laravel, requiring teamwork, application of Agile methodology (Scrum), and complex collaboration with task coordination.</p>
              <p><strong>Trace:</strong></p>
              <ul>
                <li>Teamwork with Agile methodology (Scrum)</li>
                <li>Task coordination with work distribution</li>

              </ul>
              <p><strong>Justification:</strong> This project allowed me to <strong>participate in a project organization (AC26.01)</strong> by collaborating effectively with the team and coordinating tasks so everyone worked in the same direction. I also learned to <strong>develop professional communication (AC26.02)</strong> by documenting my work and regularly communicating project progress to the team. I used Agile methodology (Scrum) to organize our teamwork in a structured way.</p>
              <p><strong>Reflection:</strong> This project was my first in-depth experience with Agile methodology in a team. The main difficulty was coordinating tasks between multiple developers and managing complex interactions. I overcame this difficulty by using project management tools (Trello, GitHub), organizing regular meetings, and applying Agile methodology principles. This project showed me the importance of coordination and communication in complex teamwork.</p>

              <p><strong>Justification:</strong> This project allowed me to <strong>participate in a project organization (AC26.01)</strong> by collaborating effectively with the team on a complex project that used several different technologies.

I also improved my ability to <strong>develop professional communication (AC26.02)</strong> by documenting technical choices we made and regularly communicating progress. I applied skills developed in resource R4.06 (Groups, Meetings).</p>
              <p><strong>Reflection:</strong> This project was the most complex in terms of collaboration as it combined several technologies requiring effective coordination. The main difficulty was coordinating work between backend (.NET) and frontend (Vue.js) developers. I overcame this difficulty by organizing regular technical meetings, documenting interfaces, and applying collaboration best practices. This project showed me the importance of technical communication and coordination in complex projects.</p>

              <p><strong>Context:</strong> Professional internship of 3 months (June-August 2024) at Helvetic Events Agency in Geneva, as a Web Developer. I participated in enterprise integration, professional collaboration with a developer team, understanding my role and missions, applying an integration approach, and reporting on my activity.</p>
              <p><strong>Trace:</strong></p>
              <ul>
                <li>Enterprise integration with understanding of the organization</li>
                <li>Professional collaboration with developer team</li>
                <li>Situate my role and missions in the organization</li>
                <li>Application of an integration approach</li>
                <li>Mobilization of adapted interpersonal skills</li>
                <li>Reporting on my activity with regular reporting</li>
                <li>Web application in production (proprietary, not public)</li>
                <li>Detailed project sheet (<a href="/en/projects/heva.html">see project sheet</a>)</li>
              </ul>
              <p><strong>Justification:</strong> This internship allowed me to <strong>participate in a project organization (AC26.01)</strong> by discovering how projects were organized in the company and contributing to their structuring. I also learned to <strong>develop professional communication (AC26.02)</strong> by adapting to the developer team's functioning, communicating regularly with the team and explaining what I had done. I used resources R3.13 (CV, Interview, Popularization) and R4.06 (Groups, Meetings, Infographics and Data Visualization).</p>
              <p><strong>Reflection:</strong> This internship was an enriching professional experience that allowed me to develop my complex collaboration skills in a real context. The main difficulty was understanding how to integrate into an existing professional team and understanding company processes. I overcame this difficulty by communicating regularly with the team, asking questions, and applying developed interpersonal skills. This internship showed me the importance of integration and communication in the professional world and allowed me to develop my ability to collaborate effectively in a team.</p>

            <strong>Progression</strong>
            Level 2 allowed me to develop my complex collaboration skills. Through projects like SAÉ 2.06, SAÉ 3.01, SAÉ 4.01 and my internship at Helvetics Events, I learned to situate my role and missions in an organization, apply an integration approach, mobilize adapted interpersonal skills, and report on my activity. These experiences allowed me to develop expertise in complex collaboration, from understanding my role to contributing to technical decisions. The internship particularly taught me to collaborate in a real professional context, thus preparing my entry into the professional world.
