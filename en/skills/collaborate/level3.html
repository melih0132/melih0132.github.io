            <strong>Level 3</strong> of the <strong>COLLABORATE</strong> competency corresponds to leadership and advanced collaboration. This competency represents the third level of learning (Critical Learning AC36), the most advanced level. In my Application Development pathway, only the REALIZE, OPTIMIZE and COLLABORATE competencies are evaluated at level 3 in semesters 5 and 6. At this level, I am able to organize and share technological monitoring (surveillance of new technologies), guide change management (accompany transformations), support project management (support project management), and identify economic issues of innovation (understand the economic impact of innovations).

            <h3 class="proof-card__title">EVIDENCE 1: SmartHome (IoT/AI technological monitoring, team management)</h3>
            <div class="proof-card__section">
              <p><strong>Context:</strong> Academic project carried out in the third year (Semester 5) as part of SAÉ 5.01. This is a complex project developing an Android mobile application with Kotlin, integrating IoT (Internet of Things) via MQTT and Raspberry Pi, and using artificial intelligence, requiring organization and sharing of technological monitoring, guidance of change management, and support for project management.</p>
              <p><strong>Trace:</strong></p>
              <ul>
                <li>Organization and sharing of technological monitoring (IoT, AI) with documentation</li>
                <li>Guidance of change management in the team</li>
                <li>Support for project management with RACI and conflict management (R5.01)</li>
                <li>Organized and shared technological monitoring with the team (R5.03)</li>
                <li>Identification of economic issues via Digital Fresco (R5.13)</li>
                <li>Application source code (project in progress, confidential)</li>
              </ul>
              <p><strong>Justification:</strong> This project allowed me to learn to <strong>organize and share technological monitoring (AC36.01)</strong> by monitoring new IoT and AI technologies and regularly sharing interesting information with the team. I also discovered how to <strong>guide change management (AC36.02)</strong> by supporting the team in adopting new technologies and helping them understand their usefulness. Finally, I developed my skills to <strong>support project management (AC36.03)</strong> by using RACI to clarify responsibilities and managing conflicts constructively. I used resources R5.01 (Team management), R5.03 (Technological monitoring) and R5.13 (Digital Fresco).</p>
              <p><strong>Reflection:</strong> This project is the most complex in terms of leadership and advanced collaboration as it combines several aspects: technological monitoring, change management, and project management. The main difficulty was effectively organizing technological monitoring and guiding the team in adopting new technologies. I overcame this difficulty by structuring technological monitoring, regularly sharing information with the team, and applying team management methods taught in resource R5.01. This project showed me the importance of leadership and technological monitoring in complex projects.</p>

            <div class="proof-card__section">
              <p><strong>Context:</strong> Professional work-study since September 2025 as a Web Developer at Agence Altimax in Annecy. I participate in leadership, WordPress technological monitoring, team collaboration, organization and sharing of technological monitoring, guidance of change management, support for project management, and identification of economic issues of innovation.</p>

              </ul>
              <p><strong>Justification:</strong> This work-study allowed me to learn to <strong>organize and share technological monitoring (AC36.01)</strong> by monitoring WordPress news and sharing interesting information with the team. I discovered the importance of staying up to date and sharing discoveries. I also learned to <strong>identify the economic issues of digital innovation (AC36.02)</strong> by analyzing the economic impact of innovations we implemented. I developed my skills to <strong>guide the conduct of IT change (AC36.03)</strong> by supporting the team in adopting new practices and helping them understand their usefulness. Finally, I learned to <strong>support IT project management (AC36.04)</strong> by managing projects and coordinating teams. This daily experience allows me to apply my leadership and collaboration skills in a real context with all professional constraints.</p>
              <p><strong>Reflection:</strong> This work-study is a continuous professional experience that allows me to develop my leadership and advanced collaboration skills in a real context. The main difficulty was understanding how to effectively organize technological monitoring and how to guide change management in a company. I overcame this difficulty by communicating regularly with the team, sharing monitoring information, and applying team management methods. This experience showed me the importance of leadership and technological monitoring in the professional world and allowed me to develop my ability to lead and collaborate effectively.</p>

            <strong>Progression</strong>
            Level 3 represents the culmination of my progression in collaboration. Through projects like SmartHome (SAÉ 5.01) and my work-study at Agence Altimax, I developed my ability to organize and share technological monitoring, guide change management, support project management, and identify economic issues of innovation. These experiences allowed me to develop expertise in leadership and advanced collaboration, from organizing technological monitoring to identifying economic issues. The work-study particularly taught me to lead and collaborate in a real professional context, thus preparing my entry into the professional world as a technical leader or manager.
