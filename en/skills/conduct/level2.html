            <strong>Level 2</strong> of the <strong>CONDUCT</strong> competency corresponds to complex project management. This competency is part of the 6 competencies of the BUT Computer Science program and represents the second level of learning (Critical Learning AC25). At this level, I am able to formalize business needs (precisely document expectations), define feasibility criteria (assess if the project is feasible), and implement adapted project monitoring (effectively track progress).

          <p class="project-details__desc-para">
            This level represents an evolution in my ability to manage more complex projects, use structured methodologies (organized methods like Scrum), and coordinate teams. These skills were developed mainly during <strong>semesters 3 and 4</strong> (second year of BUT Computer Science) through educational resources R2.10, R2.14, R3.10 and R4.07, as well as academic projects SAÉ 2.05, SAÉ 3.01, SAÉ 4.01 and my internship at HEVA.

              <p><strong>Context:</strong> Academic project carried out in the second year (Semester 2) as part of SAÉ 2.05. This was a project management project requiring the formalization of business needs, the definition of feasibility criteria, and the implementation of adapted project monitoring with a Gantt chart.</p>
              <p><strong>Trace:</strong></p>
              <ul>
                <li>Specifications document (document describing needs and requirements)</li>

              </ul>
              <p><strong>Justification:</strong> This project taught me to <strong>formalize business needs (AC25.01)</strong> by creating a complete specifications document that precisely described what was expected. I also discovered how to <strong>define feasibility criteria (AC25.02)</strong> by evaluating technical, economic and organizational constraints to know if the project was feasible. Finally, I learned to <strong>implement adapted project monitoring (AC25.03)</strong> by using a Gantt chart to plan and track progress. I used resource R2.10 (Management, accounting and Gantt).</p>
              <p><strong>Reflection:</strong> This project was my first in-depth experience in structured project management. The main difficulty was understanding how to formalize needs precisely and create a realistic schedule with the Gantt chart. I overcame this difficulty by studying needs formalization methods, practicing with planning tools, and applying concepts taught in resource R2.10. This project showed me the importance of planning and monitoring in project success.</p>

              <p><strong>Justification:</strong> This project allowed me to learn to <strong>formalize business needs (AC25.01)</strong> by creating detailed functional specifications that served as a reference for the entire team. I also discovered the <strong>Agile methodology (Scrum) for project monitoring (AC25.03)</strong> by organizing work into sprints, using user stories, and tracking progress with boards. I applied what I learned in resource R3.10 (Agile Methodology - Scrum).</p>
              <p><strong>Reflection:</strong> This project was my first experience with Agile methodology (Scrum).

              <p><strong>Justification:</strong> This project allowed me to learn to <strong>implement adapted project monitoring (AC25.03)</strong> by managing a complex project that used several different technologies. I also discovered the importance of project communication by creating a trailer (video) and a pitch (oral presentation) to explain the project convincingly. I used resource R4.07 (PPP - Trailer/Pitch) to learn these communication techniques.</p>
              <p><strong>Reflection:</strong> This project was the most complex in terms of project management as it combined several technologies (.NET, Vue.js) requiring effective coordination. The main difficulty was managing communication between different parts of the project and creating an effective presentation. I overcame this difficulty by applying agile methodologies, communicating regularly with the team, and using techniques taught in resource R4.07.

              <p><strong>Context:</strong> Professional internship of 3 months (June-August 2024) at HEVA - Helvetic Events Agency in Geneva, as a Web Developer. I participated in professional project management, web application project management, formalization of needs, and adapted project monitoring in a real professional context.</p>
              <p><strong>Trace:</strong></p>
              <ul>
                <li>Professional project management in a real context</li>
                <li>Web application project management with formalization of needs</li>
                <li>Adapted project monitoring with professional tools</li>
                <li>Web application in production (proprietary, not public)</li>
                <li>Project sheet available on <a href="/en/projects/heva.html">/en/projects/heva.html</a></li>
              </ul>
              <p><strong>Justification:</strong> This internship allowed me to learn to <strong>formalize business needs (AC25.01)</strong> in a real professional context, by understanding what clients really expected and documenting their needs clearly. I also discovered how to <strong>monitor a project with professional tools (AC25.03)</strong> by using the tools the company used to track progress. This experience allowed me to apply my project management skills in a real context with all professional constraints.</p>
              <p><strong>Reflection:</strong> This internship was an enriching professional experience that allowed me to develop my project management skills in a real context. The main difficulty was understanding how to adapt methods learned in class to real professional constraints. I overcame this difficulty by communicating regularly with the team, following company procedures, and applying project management best practices. This internship showed me the importance of flexibility in project management and allowed me to develop my ability to manage professional projects.</p>

              <div class="reflection-card__content">To overcome these difficulties, I studied needs formalization methods, practiced with agile methodologies (Scrum), used planning tools (Gantt), developed my project communication skills, and applied methods taught in educational resources R2.10, R2.14, R3.10 and R4.07.</div>

            <strong>Progression</strong>
            Level 2 allowed me to develop my complex project management skills. Through projects like SAÉ 2.05, SAÉ 3.01, SAÉ 4.01 and my internship at HEVA, I learned to formalize business needs, define feasibility criteria, and implement adapted project monitoring with agile methodologies. These experiences allowed me to develop expertise in complex project management, from needs formalization to team coordination. The internship particularly taught me to adapt methods learned to real professional constraints, thus preparing my entry into the professional world.
