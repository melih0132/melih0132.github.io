            <h3 class="proof-card__title">EVIDENCE 1: SAÉ 5.01 - SmartHome (Impact measurement, system integration, team management)</h3>
            <div class="proof-card__section">
              <p><strong>Context:</strong> Academic project carried out in the third year (Semester 5) as part of SAÉ 5.01. This is a complex project developing an Android mobile application with Kotlin, integrating IoT (Internet of Things) via MQTT and Raspberry Pi, and using artificial intelligence, requiring impact measurement, integration into an information system, and team management.</p>
              <p><strong>Trace:</strong></p>
              <ul>
                <li>Measurement of project impacts (economic, societal, environmental) via Digital Fresco (R5.13)</li>
                <li>Integration of a project into an information system with mapping (R4.09)</li>
                <li>Team management with RACI (responsibility matrix) and conflict management (R5.01)</li>
                <li>Information system architecture documentation</li>
                <li>Application source code (project in progress, confidential)</li>
              </ul>
              <p><strong>Justification:</strong> This project allowed me to learn to <strong>measure project impacts (AC35.01)</strong> by using the Digital Fresco to evaluate the economic, societal and environmental impacts of our work. I also discovered how to <strong>integrate a project into an information system (AC35.02)</strong> by creating a mapping that showed how everything was articulated and by integrating several technologies (mobile, IoT, AI). Finally, I developed my team management skills by using RACI to clarify roles and managing conflicts that could arise. I used resources R5.01 (Team management), R4.09 (IS Mapping) and R5.13 (Digital Fresco).</p>
              <p><strong>Reflection:</strong> This project is the most complex in terms of project management as it combines several aspects: impact measurement, system integration, and team management. The main difficulty was coordinating all these aspects while managing a team and measuring project impacts. I overcame this difficulty by applying team management methods (RACI), using mapping to visualize system integration, and applying Digital Fresco concepts to measure impacts. This project showed me the importance of a global vision in advanced project management.</p>

            <div class="proof-card__section">
              <p><strong>Context:</strong> Professional work-study since September 2025 (4 months, in progress) as a Web Developer at Agence Altimax in Annecy. I participate in project management, specification tracking, use of RACI, impact measurement, integration of projects into the information system, and adaptation of the information system to organizational needs.</p>

              </ul>
              <p><strong>Justification:</strong> This work-study allowed me to learn to <strong>measure project impacts (AC35.01)</strong> by evaluating the economic and societal impacts of the projects we developed. I discovered the importance of thinking about the consequences of our work. I also learned to <strong>integrate a project into an information system (AC35.02)</strong> by integrating WordPress sites into the company's information system so they work with the rest. Finally, I developed my ability to <strong>adapt an information system to evolving needs (AC35.03)</strong> by adapting sites to changing client needs. This daily experience allows me to apply my project management skills in a real context with all professional constraints.</p>
              <p><strong>Reflection:</strong> This work-study is a continuous professional experience that allows me to develop my advanced project management skills in a real context. The main difficulty was understanding how to measure project impacts in a professional context and how to adapt systems to changing client needs. I overcame this difficulty by communicating regularly with the team, using RACI to clarify responsibilities, and applying project management best practices. This experience showed me the importance of flexibility and adaptation in professional project management and allowed me to develop my ability to manage complex projects in production.</p>

            <strong>Progression</strong>
            Level 3 represents the culmination of my progression in project management. Through projects like SmartHome (SAÉ 5.01) and my work-study at Agence Altimax, I developed my ability to measure project impacts, integrate a project into an information system, and adapt an information system to evolving needs. These experiences allowed me to develop expertise in advanced project management, from impact measurement to system adaptation. The work-study particularly taught me to manage complex projects in production with real constraints, thus preparing my entry into the professional world as a project manager or manager.
