            <strong>Level 3</strong> of the <strong>MANAGE</strong> competency corresponds to advanced data management and big data (management of very large amounts of data). This competency is part of the 6 competencies of the BUT Computer Science program and represents the third level of learning (Critical Learning AC34), the most advanced level. At this level, I am able to design data architectures (complex organization of data systems), use NoSQL technologies (non-relational databases), and manage data governance (rules and processes for managing data).

            <div class="proof-card__section">
              <p><strong>Context:</strong> Academic project carried out in the third year (Semester 5) as part of SAÉ 5.01. This is a complex project developing an Android mobile application with Kotlin, integrating IoT (Internet of Things) via MQTT and Raspberry Pi, and using artificial intelligence for data classification, requiring advanced data management with MongoDB.</p>
              <p><strong>Trace:</strong></p>
              <ul>
                <li>Data architecture with advanced MongoDB to store IoT data</li>
                <li>Decision support system to analyze collected data</li>
                <li>Data visualization and infographics to present data (R4.06)</li>
                <li>Information system mapping (R4.09)</li>
                <li>Application source code with data management (project in progress, confidential)</li>
              </ul>
              <p><strong>Justification:</strong> This project allowed me to learn to <strong>design and implement decision support systems (AC34.01)</strong> by creating a system that analyzed all the IoT data we collected. I also discovered how to <strong>integrate complex data management solutions (AC34.02)</strong> by using advanced MongoDB to manage the large amounts of data coming from IoT. I used knowledge from resources R4.03 (MongoDB), R4.06 (Data visualization), R5.10 (Advanced MongoDB) and R4.09 (IS Mapping).</p>
              <p><strong>Reflection:</strong> This project is the most complex in terms of data management as it combines several data sources (IoT, AI, mobile) requiring a sophisticated data architecture. The main difficulty was designing a MongoDB architecture adapted to manage real-time IoT data while allowing analysis and classification by AI. I overcame this difficulty by studying data architectures for IoT, practicing with advanced MongoDB, and applying concepts taught in resources R4.03, R4.06, R5.10 and R4.09. This project showed me the importance of designing data architectures for complex systems.</p>

              <p><strong>Justification:</strong> This work-study allowed me to learn to <strong>integrate complex data management solutions (AC34.02)</strong> in a real professional context, by managing MySQL databases for WordPress sites. I discovered the real challenges of data management in production. I also learned to <strong>take into account regulatory issues (AC34.03)</strong> by respecting GDPR in client data management, which is essential today. This daily experience allows me to apply my data management skills in a real context with all production and compliance constraints.</p>
              <p><strong>Reflection:</strong> This work-study is a continuous professional experience that allows me to develop my advanced data management skills in a real context. The main difficulty was understanding how to manage client data while respecting GDPR and optimizing performance. I overcame this difficulty by studying GDPR requirements, communicating with the team, and applying data management best practices. This experience showed me the importance of regulatory compliance in professional data management and allowed me to develop my ability to manage data in a production context.</p>

Through projects like SmartHome (SAÉ 5.01) and my work-study at Agence Altimax, I developed my ability to design complex data architectures, integrate advanced data management solutions, and take into account regulatory issues (GDPR). These experiences allowed me to develop expertise in advanced data management, from designing complex architectures to regulatory compliance. The work-study particularly taught me to manage data in production with real constraints, thus preparing my entry into the professional world.
