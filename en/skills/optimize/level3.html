            <h3 class="proof-card__title">EVIDENCE 1: SAÉ 5.01 - SmartHome (AI Classification and IoT optimization)</h3>
            <div class="proof-card__section">
              <p><strong>Context:</strong> Academic project carried out in the third year (Semester 5) as part of SAÉ 5.01. This is a complex project developing an Android mobile application with Kotlin, integrating IoT (Internet of Things) via MQTT and Raspberry Pi, and using artificial intelligence for data classification, requiring advanced performance optimization.</p>
              <p><strong>Trace:</strong></p>
              <ul>
                <li>Kotlin application source code with optimized AI algorithms (project in progress, confidential)</li>
                <li>Optimized IoT architecture with MQTT (communication protocol for IoT) and Raspberry Pi</li>
                <li>AI integration for classification with performance optimization</li>
                <li>Performance analysis and optimization documentation</li>
              </ul>
              <p><strong>Justification:</strong> This project allowed me to learn to <strong>anticipate and evaluate performance (AC32.01)</strong> by thinking about execution time, memory and load needs for AI and IoT before even starting to code. I also developed my ability to <strong>analyze code and propose optimizations (AC32.02)</strong> by identifying parts that slowed down IoT data processing and AI algorithm execution. I had to <strong>justify my algorithmic choices (AC32.03)</strong> by selecting the most appropriate AI algorithms (classification) taking into account both performance and precision. I used resources R5.11 (Optimization method) and R5.12 (AI - Classification).</p>
              <p><strong>Reflection:</strong> This project is the most complex in terms of optimization as it combines three different domains: mobile development, IoT and artificial intelligence, each with its own performance constraints. The main difficulty was optimizing AI algorithms so they execute quickly on a mobile device while maintaining good classification precision. I overcame this difficulty by using optimization techniques taught in R5.11, analyzing performance with profiling tools, and applying optimized AI methods from R5.12. This project showed me the importance of optimization in systems integrating several complex technologies.</p>

          <div class="proof-card">
            <h3 class="proof-card__title">EVIDENCE 2: WORK-STUDY - Agence Altimax (WordPress code optimization)</h3>
            <div class="proof-card__section">
              <p><strong>Context:</strong> Professional work-study since September 2025 (4 months, in progress) as a Web Developer at Agence Altimax in Annecy. I develop and maintain websites with WordPress, optimizing code, improving performance, and analyzing bottlenecks to propose optimizations.</p>
              <p><strong>Trace:</strong></p>
              <ul>
                <li>Optimized WordPress websites in production (proprietary, not public)</li>
                <li>PHP, HTML, CSS, JavaScript code optimizations performed</li>
                <li>Measured performance improvements (loading time reduction, query optimization)</li>
                <li>Performance analyses with profiling tools</li>
                <li>Optimization documentation and justification of algorithmic choices</li>
                <li>Regular contributions with documented Git commits</li>
              </ul>
              <p><strong>Justification:</strong> This work-study allowed me to learn to <strong>anticipate and evaluate performance (AC32.01)</strong> by thinking about the impact of my optimizations on loading time and user experience before implementing them. I also developed my ability to <strong>analyze code and propose optimizations (AC32.02)</strong> by identifying parts of WordPress code that slowed down sites, using profiling tools to understand where problems were, and proposing concrete solutions. I had to <strong>justify my algorithmic choices (AC32.03)</strong> by selecting the best optimization techniques taking into account multiple constraints: performance, maintainability and compatibility with WordPress. This daily experience allows me to apply my level 3 skills in a real professional context with all production constraints.</p>
              <p><strong>Reflection:</strong> This work-study is a continuous professional experience that allows me to develop my advanced optimization skills in a real context. The main difficulty was understanding how to optimize existing WordPress code without breaking functionality, while respecting company constraints. I overcame this difficulty by analyzing code with profiling tools, testing optimizations on development environments, and measuring performance improvements. This experience showed me the importance of continuous optimization in a professional context and allowed me to develop my ability to justify my algorithmic choices in the face of multiple constraints (performance, cost, maintainability, deadlines).</p>

            <strong>Progression</strong>
            Level 3 represents the culmination of my progression in optimization. Through projects like SmartHome (SAÉ 5.01) and my work-study at Agence Altimax, I developed my ability to optimize complex systems, manage scalability (ability to handle increasing load), and implement advanced optimization solutions. These experiences allowed me to develop expertise in advanced optimization, from performance prediction to implementation of optimized solutions in production. The work-study particularly taught me to justify my algorithmic choices in the face of real professional constraints, thus preparing my entry into the professional world.
